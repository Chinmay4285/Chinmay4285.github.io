			<p>This is a multiclass image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks and TensorFlow API (no Keras) on Python.
			     I got this file as part of the Keras project and used some open source code to develop it. 
				I trained the model with 10 epochs and you can see the detailed results in GIThub repo. I used Intel AI cloud to train my model for faster execution of epochs.</p>
			<p> About <b>ALEXNET</b> -- AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is 8 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.</p>
