			<p>It is a multiclass image classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks and TensorFlow API (no Keras) on Python.
			     I got this file as part of the Keras project and used some open source code to develop it. 
				I trained the model with ten epochs, and you can see the detailed results in the GitHub repo. I used the Intel AI cloud to train my model for faster execution of epochs.</p>
			<p> About <b>ALEXNET</b> -- AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is 8 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.</p>

			<img src="{{site.url}}/Images/Regression.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;"/>
			<p>This project is part of my ML Made Easy article series on the Medium. I have created a small block of codes which would help beginners understand what is
			regression and various types of regressions. I have covered linear, multiple linear, decision tree regression, polynomial regression, and SVM regression. I have used Python to code and 
			all codes are available in the format of Jupyter notebooks.</p>
